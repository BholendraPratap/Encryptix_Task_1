Credit Card Fraud Detection

Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains transactions made by credit cards, with labeled instances indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The goal is to build a classification model to identify fraudulent transactions accurately.

Dataset

Due to the large dataset size, it is not included in this repository. You can download it from Kaggle using the following link:

After downloading, place the dataset in the data/ directory within the project folder.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing:

Handling imbalanced data using techniques like SMOTE.

Feature scaling and transformation.

Splitting dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Training:

Using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Evaluating model performance using metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-score.


Results:

Achieved high recall for fraudulent transactions.

Balanced accuracy to minimize false negatives.

Used AUC-ROC as the primary evaluation metric.
